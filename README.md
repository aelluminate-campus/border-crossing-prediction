# border-crossing-prediction
This project aims to develop a predictive model to forecast border crossing volumes using historical data on U.S. land port entries. With increasing cross-border movement, the ability to accurately predict border traffic is essential for efficient resource allocation, traffic management, and strategic planning at ports of entry.
